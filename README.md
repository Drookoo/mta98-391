### Perform Operations using Data types and operators

### Identify str, int, float, and bool data types
type(variable)

### Convert from one data type to another
float()
int()
str()
list() <--> tuple()

### Create data structures 
empty_list = []
empty_dict = {}

#### Add stuff to the end of a list
.append()

#### Remove from the end 
.pop()

### Perform indexing and slicing operations
list = [1, 2, 4, 3]
 
First element: 
list[0] --> 1 

Last Element: 
list[-1] --> 3

Splicing lists:
list[1:3] --> [2, 3]

Omit the Beginning: 
list[2:] --> [4, 3]

Omit the end:
list[:3] --> [1, 2, 4]

Select every second entry:
list[::2] --> [1, 4]

Revert a copy of the list:
list[::-1] --> [3, 4, 2, 1]

Get the index of the first item found:
list.index(2) --> 1  
### Determine the sequence of execution based on operator precedence:
###Assignment, comparison, logical, arithmetic, identity is, containment in

### Select the appropriate operator to achieve the intended result
### Assignment, comparison, logical, arithmetic, identity is, containment in

## Control Flow with Decisions and Loops

if var > 10:
    print("this will run if the var is bigger than 10 ")
elif some_var < 10: 
    print("this will run if the var is less than 10")
else: 
    print("this will run if the var is 10")

nested and compound conditional expressions 

while
for
break 
continue
pass
nested loops
loops with conditional expressions

## Perform Input and Output Operations

Open, close, read, write, append, check existence, delete, with statement 


raw_input()
print formatted text, use of command line arguments 


how to use pydoc to document code: use identation, white space, documentation strings

Construct functions
Call signatures, default values, return, def, pass 

## Perform Troubleshooting and Error Handling

Analyze and detect and fix code segments that have errors:
Syntax errors, logic errors, runtime erorrs


Analyze and construct code segmentst that handle exceptions 
try, except, else, finally, raise 

## Perform Operations Using Modules and Tools
Perform basic operations using built in modules
math, datetime, io, sys, os, os.path, random 

Solve complex computing problems using built in modules 
Math, datetime, random
